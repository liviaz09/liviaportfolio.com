# Personal Website Project: Challenges and Wins

Creating a simple website portfolio using HTML and CSS was a rewarding yet challenging experience for me. Starting from scratch, I found myself on a journey of overcoming technical hurdles and celebrating small victories that ultimately helped me grow as a developer.

## Challenges I Faced

One of the main difficulties I encountered was understanding the structure of HTML and how it connects with CSS. At first, HTML seemed straightforward, but creating a logical, well-organized structure turned out to be more challenging than I expected. I struggled with choosing the right HTML elements and ensuring everything was clear and semantic. Linking external CSS files was another challenge that seemed simple yet could break the layout if I didn't do it just right or if my selectors didn’t apply as expected.

Positioning and layout with CSS was another major hurdle. CSS has various layout models, like Flexbox and Grid, which took me some time to learn and understand. Without a solid grasp of these layouts, creating a balanced and responsive design was tricky. I had to wrestle with centering elements, aligning items, and adjusting spacing—all of which became frustrating without fully understanding CSS properties. 

I also ran into cross-browser compatibility issues. CSS styles didn’t always render consistently across different browsers, which required me to spend additional time testing and making adjustments.

## Wins Along the Way

Despite the challenges, building this portfolio brought several rewarding wins. One of my first victories was getting the basic structure to render correctly. This small success boosted my confidence and pushed me to keep going. Styling elements with CSS was another enjoyable milestone. Adding colors, typography, and spacing transformed the portfolio from raw HTML to a more polished, personal look. Watching the design come to life with CSS changes made me feel creatively accomplished.

Another big win was achieving a responsive layout. Learning to use media queries and making sure my portfolio looked good on both desktop and mobile devices felt like a huge achievement, especially since I knew future employers or clients could view it on any device. 

Creating this portfolio allowed me to showcase my personality and creativity. It was exciting to select colors, choose fonts, and organize my work in a way that reflected my own style. Having the freedom to design every detail made this experience truly rewarding, and it reminded me that I could use web development as a creative outlet. 

## Reflecting on the Experience

In the end, building this simple portfolio website using HTML and CSS was a journey filled with both obstacles and triumphs. The challenges I faced, from structuring HTML to mastering CSS layouts and ensuring cross-browser compatibility, helped me develop problem-solving skills. The wins, like seeing the design take shape, achieving a responsive layout, and creating a space that feels uniquely mine, made the entire process deeply rewarding. Building this portfolio was a powerful way to strengthen my foundational web development skills, and I’m excited to share this outcome with others as a testament to what I’ve learned.
